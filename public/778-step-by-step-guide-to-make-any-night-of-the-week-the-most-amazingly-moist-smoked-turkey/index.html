<ol>
<li>Remove Turkey from packaging. Wash with cold water to remove all juices. Set aside.</li>
<li>Assemble and prepare the remaining ingredients as noted.</li>
<li>In a medium saucepan, bring the vegetable stock, salt, bay leaves, peppercorns, and mustard seeds to a boil. Stir until salt is dissolved. Cool to room temperature.</li>
<li>Once cooled, pour the brine into a 5-gallonstock pot or container. Pour in the bottle of wine, then add the shallots, garlic, thyme, and lemons. Slowly lower in the turkey (otherwise it will slosh out all over your countertop!)</li>
<li>Add ice and water to cover the turkey and either set in your refrigerator or continue adding ice to keep it below 40°. Keep the turkey in the brine for at least 24 hours.</li>
<li>After 24 hours, remove turkey and drain all liquid and remove any pepper corns or mustard seeds from within the carcass. With paper towels, dry the outer areas of the turkey. Let sit at room temperature for at least an hour.</li>
<li>In the meantime, soften your butter (not to melting) and incorporate the salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Wrap in Saran Wrap and place in refrigerator for about the same time you’re waiting for the turkey to adjust to room temp.</li>
<li>Now go outside and prepare your smoker. For any poultry, you’ll want to use either Pecan or Apple wood as your smoke base. (for this specific turkey I used pecan.)</li>
<li>While your smoker is heating, go back inside and remove the turkey and butter from the refrigerator. Separate the skin on turkey breast and thighs. In the cavities, insert the butter mixture liberally. (Seriously, you can’t add too much!)</li>
<li>Place an aluminum drip pan on the heat deflector in your smoker to catch the drippings (there will be a lot and if you don’t use a drip pan it will eventually extinguish your fire before the turkey is done.)
