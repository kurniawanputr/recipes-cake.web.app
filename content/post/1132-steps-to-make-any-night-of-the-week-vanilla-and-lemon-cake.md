- "Now add in the dry ingredients in three parts to the wet ingredients mix and make a smooth batter, add in the lemon zest and saffron too."
- "Pour in the prepared cake tin and bake it for 30 minutes on high flame (small burner) and 10 minutes on low flame (your cake will brown beautifully) in the preheated vessel or in the preheated oven for 30-40 minutes or till the skewer inserted in the centre of the cake comes out clean."
- "While the cake is baking prepare the sugar syrup drizzle. Mix all and put it on the flame and cook till the sugar melts and mix. Once done let it cool. Once cake is done and out of oven, poke holes on the cake with a skewer and with the help of silicon brush, drizzle the syrup on the cake, wait for the cake to absorb the syrup, don&#39;t pour all the syrup at one go."
- "Let it sit for sometimes in the cake tin and then cool it on a wire rack....let it come to room temperature....may take 1-2 hours. After that you can chill in the fridge too but I skipped it as I had shortage of time and it&#39;s winter now."
- "Prepare the icing..put the lemon juice little at a time to the icing sugar...till you get a desired thick consistency (it should not be too runny also).....then slowly pour and spread it on the cake....it will drip down a bit....I didn&#39;t use the whole icing....I just gave a thin layer.....it was a lightly sweetened cake with a hint of tanginess ðŸ˜€ðŸ™‚ðŸ˜‹. Decorate it with pistachio slivers and dried rose petals or anything you would like to decorate with. Bon Appetit!!!"

Just recently I remade this and. The cake is made with whole grain spelt flour, natural sweeteners and a just enough mathca powder for a light green tea flavor. It&#39;s nutritious enough to be served as a snack cake or even breakfast if you want. Line a rimmed baking pan with foil. Invert cake onto wire rack; place cake over prepared pan.
