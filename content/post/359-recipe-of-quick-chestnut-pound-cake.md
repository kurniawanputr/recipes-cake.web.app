- "1/4 cup Caster Sugar"
- "1/2 cup Sweetened Chestnut Cream Paste"

- "1 teaspoon Vanilla Extract"
recipeinstructions:
- "Place coarsely chopped Roasted Chestnuts in a small bowl, sprinkle Rum over, and set aside."
- "Preheat oven to 170°C. Grease a loaf tin and line the base and sides with baking paper."
- "Beat the softened Butter in a mixing bowl with a whisk or an electric mixer until smooth. Add Sugar and Sweetened Chestnut Paste, and beat until creamy."
