- "Pour the batter into the lined baking pan. Spread the mixture out so it evenly fills the pan."
- "Drop the pan onto the table from a little ways up a few times to remove air from the batter."
- "Bake in the oven preheated to 170℃ (356 Fahrenheit) degrees for about 45 minutes. After about 10~15 minutes of baking, cut a line on the top in the middle so that it will have a clean break as it rises."

- "It&#39;s really moist from the next day on. You can store it at room temperature, but if it&#39;s a warm season, it&#39;s better to store it in the refrigerator. If you freeze it, cut into slices first and wrap each slice individually in plastic wrap. Put into a plastic bag and store."
- "During the winter months, the butter may stay hard and difficult to mix. In this case, lightly heat the butter in the microwave to soften it. However, don&#39;t let it melt."
