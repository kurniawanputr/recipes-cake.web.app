<p>Hey everyone, I hope you&rsquo;re having an incredible day today. Today, I will show you a way to make a distinctive dish, salmon cakes. It is one of my favorites food recipes. This time, I will make it a bit tasty. This will be really delicious.</p>
<p>Salmon cakes is one of the most popular of recent trending meals in the world. It is simple, it is quick, it tastes yummy. It&rsquo;s appreciated by millions every day. Salmon cakes is something which I have loved my entire life. They are fine and they look fantastic.</p>
<p>See more ideas about Salmon cakes, Fish recipes, Seafood recipes. Salmon cakes can be served as sandwiches or without the bread as a main course. Scrumptious Salmon Cakes Haiku: &quot;Close as I could get, had to make some little swaps, still they were quite good.&quot; Salmon patties, or salmon cakes, are wonderfully easy to make.</p>
<p>To begin with this recipe, we must first prepare a few components. You can cook salmon cakes using 12 ingredients and 5 steps. Here is how you can achieve it.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="the-ingredients-needed-to-make-salmon-cakes">The ingredients needed to make Salmon cakes:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Prepare 1 1/4 lb Salmon filets</li>
<li>Prepare 2 tbsp chopped parsley</li>
<li>Get 1/2 tbsp lemon juice</li>
<li>Get 1 salt and pepper</li>
<li>Get 1 1/2 tsp Old Bay Seasoning</li>
<li>Make ready 3/4 cup small diced white onion</li>
<li>Get 1/2 tsp minced garlic</li>
<li>Make ready 1/2 cup small diced red bell pepper</li>
<li>Prepare 1/2 cup small diced Green bell pepper</li>
<li>Prepare 2 tbsp butter</li>
<li>Make ready 2 tbsp olive oil</li>
<li>Take 1 cup Panko bread crumbs</li>
</ol>
<p>With a crisp breading exterior, the salmon cakes are far from bland, since they have onions. If you enjoy seafood, salmon cakes can be a tasty new way to enjoy a fish dinner. Combined with herbs and spices, the salmon gets a crunchy, crisp coating from frying or baking it in small. I get pretty sick of meat.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="instructions-to-make-salmon-cakes">Instructions to make Salmon cakes:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Chop salmon filets in 1/4 to 1/3 pieces and mix well with bread crumbs,  green peppers,  red peppers,  onions,  lemon juice, minced garlic,  old bay seasoning,  parsley, and salt and pepper to taste.</li>
<li>Portion out 1/4 cup of salmon mixture and use hands to form into 3/4 inch thick patties. Continue to portion. You should have about 8 patties</li>
<li>Place cakes on a baking sheet with parchment paper, and sit them in the freezer until surface moisture has evaporated.</li>
<li>Add butter and olive oil to a large skillet over medium high heat.</li>
<li>Add salmon cakes and cook until medium golden brown,  about 2 minutes.  Turn cakes over and continue cooking for 2 more minutes.  Transfer salmon cakes to a plate lined with paper towel and serve.</li>
</ol>
<p>However, my budget will NOT allow it. I need to talk to my sushi place and ask them to make me all fish rolls, leaving out. They're flavorful, crispy on the outside, and perfectly moist thanks to the sweet potato. These salmon patties (salmon cakes) are incredibly moist, delicious and flavorful - they're also gluten-free, paleo and low carb. I've made them with fresh salmon, but you could also use canned salmon.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s going to wrap this up for this special food salmon cakes recipe. Thanks so much for your time. I am sure you will make this at home. There is gonna be more interesting food in home recipes coming up. Don&rsquo;t forget to save this page in your browser, and share it to your family, friends and colleague. Thanks again for reading. Go on get cooking!</p>
