<p>Hey everyone, I hope you&rsquo;re having an amazing day today. Today, we&rsquo;re going to prepare a special dish, deep fried pork chops. One of my favorites food recipes. This time, I&rsquo;m gonna make it a little bit unique. This is gonna smell and look delicious.</p>
<p>Deep fried pork chops can be found as Tonkatsu in Japan, as Scallopini in Italy, coated and fried in China, the Philipines, etc. However, for this post I'm focusing on the American favourite, Country Fried Pork Chops. Deep Fried Breaded Pork Chop is a quick dish to prepare for lunch.</p>
<p>Deep Fried Pork Chops is one of the most well liked of recent trending foods on earth. It is appreciated by millions every day. It is simple, it is quick, it tastes delicious. Deep Fried Pork Chops is something that I have loved my entire life. They are nice and they look fantastic.</p>
<p>To begin with this recipe, we have to prepare a few ingredients. You can cook deep fried pork chops using 4 ingredients and 3 steps. Here is how you cook that.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="the-ingredients-needed-to-make-deep-fried-pork-chops">The ingredients needed to make Deep Fried Pork Chops:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Get  Bone in chops</li>
<li>Prepare  flour</li>
<li>Make ready  Salt, pepper, onion and garlic powders, paprika</li>
<li>Take  Oil for frying</li>
</ol>
<p>Do you know how much time it takes or how long it takes to deep fry pork chops? Pork chops can be cooked any number of ways, but there is something about frying them that just seems right. Maybe it brings me back to all those years I spent making Wienerschnitzel at summer camp. Coat the pork chops with the starch of your choice.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="steps-to-make-deep-fried-pork-chops">Steps to make Deep Fried Pork Chops:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Heat your oil in a big enough, high sided skillet on medium high heat. I put a lid on it and do my dredging while it heats up.</li>
<li>In a dish, add your flour and seasonings. Go heavy on the seasonings. Stir it together. Salt and pepper both sides of your chops. Roll the chops in the flour and cover completely. Let them sit until the flour starts soaking into the chops. Roll again and do the same. By the time your oil is ready your chops will be thickly dredged. They’ll still have a dampish look to them.</li>
<li>I do mine in batches. Do NOT add to oil until the oil is hot enough. I’d say 350 to 375. When it’s hot enough, lay a couple of chops in the oil and let it fry. When the bubbling slows and the color is right you’ll know they’re done.</li>
</ol>
<p>They're easy to pound thin and result in a more flavorful result. If thicker pork chops are your only option, you might not be able to pound them into. Arrange the pork chops in a large shallow dish. Season each pork chop, on both sides, with salt, black pepper, garlic powder, cayenne pepper and celery seeds. Using tongs, gently lower the chops into the deep skillet in batches if necessary.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s going to wrap this up with this special food deep fried pork chops recipe. Thanks so much for your time. I am confident you will make this at home. There&rsquo;s gonna be interesting food in home recipes coming up. Remember to bookmark this page in your browser, and share it to your loved ones, friends and colleague. Thank you for reading.
