- "Transfer the dough to a bowl and let it cool down a bit about 5 minutes. Wear gloves, apply a little butter on the gloves. Take a small portion of the mung bean paste then roll it into a round ball (about 30 g per ball). Gently press it into mold."
- "Let it cool down more in the mold about 10 minutes. Put a parchment paper on the cooling grid, demold the mung bean cake on it, let sit until completely cool down. Enjoy it directly or chill in the refrigerator then eat it cold as the iced mung bean cake. (This is a low-fat formula, so the product is easy to break/crack, depending on personal preference, you may increase the amount of butter to 5.5 tablespoons)"
