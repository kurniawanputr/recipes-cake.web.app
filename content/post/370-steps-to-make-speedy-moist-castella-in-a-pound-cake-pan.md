recipeinstructions:
- "Mix all ingredients and heat to melt the honey. Sift the strong bread flour in advance. Separate the egg into egg yolk and white. Preheat the oven to 355F/180C."
- "Put egg white in a big bowl. Whisk with a hand mixer at the highest level. When it becomes white, add sugar in 2 to 3 portions and whip up well."
- "Add egg yolk and mix with the lowest level on the hand mixer to smoothen out."
- "Add strong bread flour and mix with a rubber spatula until the flouriness is gone. Be careful not to knead."
- "Mix the ingredients and vegetable oil and mix well evenly from the bottom. When it is fluffy and becomes shiny, then it is OK."
- "Pour it in a cake pan lined with baking sheets and tap the cake pan to eliminate air pockets. Bake for 10 minutes in 355F/180C. Then reduce the temperature of the oven to 305F/150C and bake for another 20 minutes."
- "Prepare the cellophane wrap while baking. Spread a big sheet tightly on a cutting board."
- "When the castella is done, face the browned side down on the wrap and remove the cake pan. Make sure that the cellophane wrap doesn&#39;t wrinkle and center the castella in the middle."
- "Peel the oven sheet and wrap tightly with the cellophane wrap while the castella is still warm. This process will keep the castella moist."
- "Let it sit for a while with the browned side facing down. From next day onward, it&#39;s ready to eat.  Cut right before eating. You can store it for about 3 days in room temperature."
- "Revision For the coffee flavor, it wasn&#39;t 1/2 of tablespoon but it was 1 tablespoon."
