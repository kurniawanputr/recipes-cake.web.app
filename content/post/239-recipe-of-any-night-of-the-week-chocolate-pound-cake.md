- "Transfer into a loaf pan that has been fully coated with butter. This will help unmold the cake easily."
- "Spread up the batter to both ends of the pan. Pipe a line of softened butter along the center lengthwise. These steps are optional, but they will help create an evenly-centered crack."
- "Bake in a preheated oven at 340째F (170째C) for 40 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean."
- "Run a spatula between the cake and the pan. Unmold the cake immediately after baking to prevent shrinking. Let cool on the cooling rack. With a sifter, garnish the top with icing sugar before slicing (optional)."
