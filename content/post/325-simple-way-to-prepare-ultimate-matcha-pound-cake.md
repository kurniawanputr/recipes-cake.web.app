recipeingredient:
- "50 g butter"
- "50 g caster suger"
- "50 g self raising flour"
- "1 egg"
- "1/2 tea spoon matcha"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat the oven on 170°C. Prepare 50g room temperature butter is a bowl. Add 50g of caster sugar, and beat them until smooth. I used a wooden spoon since I don&#39;t have electronic mixer inn my kitchen. It&#39;s not so different and didn&#39;t take too much extra time and effort as long as the butter was at room temperature. You will want to achieve a matte finish."
- "Break an egg in a separate bowl, and measure only 50g to add to the mixture bowl. Mix the mixture with a silicon stapula."
- "Measure another 50 gram of self raising flour. Add to the mixture bowl batch by batch. You don&#39;t want to throw all the flour at once because that could make it hard to mix evenly. I added the flour in roughly 6 batches."
- "This is an optional step. I added 1/2 tea spoon of matcha powder. You can use chocolate power instead if you don&#39;t have matcha powder. That will turn the pound cake to chocolate flavour obviously. When it&#39;s mixed well, you are ready to pour them in the tin."
- "Prepare a baking tin brushed gently with butter and tear a layer of baking paper to the tin. Pour the mixture in the tin and make it even. Put the tin with mixture in oven at 170°C for about 30 minutes."
- "Again this is optional but we sprinkled a bit more matcha powder on top of the cake before serve :)"
