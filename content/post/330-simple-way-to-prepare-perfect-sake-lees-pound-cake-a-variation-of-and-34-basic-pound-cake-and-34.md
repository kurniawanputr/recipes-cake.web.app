- " Basic pound cake"
- "2 Eggs"
- "1 the same weight as the eggs Butter"
- "1 the same weight as the eggs Sugar"
- "1 the same weight as the eggs Cake flour"
- "2 teaspons Baking powder optional"
- "1/4 to 12 of the weight of the eggs Sake lees"
recipeinstructions:
- "A hint for measuring the ingredients: The weight of the egg is the base. Two eggs normally weighs between 150 to 200 g.  Determine the amounts of the other ingredients by matching the weight of the eggs."
- "Preheat the oven to 160℃.  Line the pound cake pan with parchment paper or grease it with butter."
- "In a bowl, add butter softened in the microwave and sugar.  Cream them with an electric mixer for 2 to 3 minutes or until white."
- "When you are making sake lees pound cake, add the sake lees at this point!  If the sake lees is too solid to mix with an electric mixer, add some hot water to soften it beforehand."
- "In a separate bowl, beat the eggs until fluffy with an electric mixer (about 5 minutes)."
- "Add the eggs from Step 4 into the Step 3 bowl and mix until incorporated."
- "Sift in the cake flour and fold it in.  In the winter time, the butter tends to harden easily, and it gets stiffer."
- "To make the batter a little fluffier, add the baking powder at this point.  The amount should be 1 teaspoon per 100 g of flour."
- "Pour the batter into the pound cake pan. Drop the pan on to the table to remove any trapped air. Dent the center of the batter a little. You can do so by wetting your finger and pressing through the center."
- "Bake slowly at 160℃ for about 40 minutes."
- "If you wish to make it look elegant, make a slit down the center of the cake with a knife when the surface starts to brown, around 10 minutes after you start baking!"
- "Insert a bamboo skewer and if it comes out clean, it is done. Take it out of the pan, wrap it with plastic wrap and let it cool."
