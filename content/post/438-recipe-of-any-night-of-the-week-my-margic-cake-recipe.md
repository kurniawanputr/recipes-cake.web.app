This recipe is the Magic Cake from Jo Cooks. I&#39;ve been reading Jo Cooks for a long time, but it wasn&#39;t until recently that I got to know Jo herself. Though actually, her real name is Ioana - a Romanian name, a beautiful one at that, and one of the first things I nagged her about was why she doesn&#39;t go by her. I mean, it left me in a state of delicious shock that something so simple could create an incredible piece of dessert. It looked so easy and like magic, it separated into three layers.
