<p>Hey everyone, hope you&rsquo;re having an incredible day today. Today, we&rsquo;re going to make a special dish, salmon cakes. It is one of my favorites. This time, I will make it a little bit unique. This is gonna smell and look delicious.</p>
<p>Salmon Cakes is one of the most well liked of current trending foods in the world. It is enjoyed by millions daily. It&rsquo;s easy, it&rsquo;s quick, it tastes yummy. Salmon Cakes is something that I have loved my entire life. They are fine and they look fantastic.</p>
<p>See more ideas about Salmon cakes, Fish recipes, Seafood recipes. Salmon cakes can be served as sandwiches or without the bread as a main course. Scrumptious Salmon Cakes Haiku: &quot;Close as I could get, had to make some little swaps, still they were quite good.&quot; Salmon patties, or salmon cakes, are wonderfully easy to make.</p>
<p>To get started with this particular recipe, we must first prepare a few components. You can cook salmon cakes using 8 ingredients and 7 steps. Here is how you can achieve it.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="the-ingredients-needed-to-make-salmon-cakes">The ingredients needed to make Salmon Cakes:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Prepare  cooked salmon (or 6 oz canned, drained)</li>
<li>Make ready  mayonnaise</li>
<li>Get  worcestershire</li>
<li>Get  green onion, thinly sliced</li>
<li>Get  your favorite seasoning blend- we like Tony's</li>
<li>Get  breadcrumbs</li>
<li>Prepare  egg, beaten</li>
<li>Prepare  butter</li>
</ol>
<p>With a crisp breading exterior, the salmon cakes are far from bland, since they have onions. If you enjoy seafood, salmon cakes can be a tasty new way to enjoy a fish dinner. Combined with herbs and spices, the salmon gets a crunchy, crisp coating from frying or baking it in small. I get pretty sick of meat.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="instructions-to-make-salmon-cakes">Instructions to make Salmon Cakes:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Mix the salmon with the mayonnaise, worcestershire, green onion, seasoning, and breadcrumbs.</li>
<li>Taste the mixture! Make sure it's salty enough. If it's too salty, add more breadcrumbs. For extra flavor, throw in any fresh herbs you have handy.</li>
<li>Gently fold in the egg. The mixture should just hold together when scooped; add a bit more mayo if it's too dry.</li>
<li>Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add the butter to it, swirling to coat the pan.</li>
<li>Divide the salmon mixture into 8 parts. Form by scooping them out with a large spoon, gently pressing them flat with your hand, and sliding into the pan. It's okay if they're a little wonky!</li>
<li>Let them brown for a minute or two per side; they'll stick until they're ready to be flipped.</li>
<li>Serve immediately, with veggies and macaroni and cheese if you're like us!</li>
</ol>
<p>However, my budget will NOT allow it. I need to talk to my sushi place and ask them to make me all fish rolls, leaving out. They're flavorful, crispy on the outside, and perfectly moist thanks to the sweet potato. These salmon patties (salmon cakes) are incredibly moist, delicious and flavorful - they're also gluten-free, paleo and low carb. I've made them with fresh salmon, but you could also use canned salmon.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s going to wrap it up for this special food salmon cakes recipe. Thanks so much for reading. I am confident that you will make this at home. There&rsquo;s gonna be interesting food at home recipes coming up. Don&rsquo;t forget to save this page in your browser, and share it to your loved ones, colleague and friends. Thank you for reading. Go on get cooking!</p>
