recipeingredient:
- " Unsalted butter or margarine"
- " Sugar"
- " Eggs"
- " Cake flour sifted"
- " Baking powder"
- " enough to turn the batter bright green Matcha"
- " heaping tablespoons Plain yogurt"
- " as much to taste Amanatto"
- " drops Matcha tea essence optional"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat the oven to 355°F/180°C. Sift the dry ingredients together (you can skip this step... I do.)"
- "Soften the butter at room temperature, or microwave for a few seconds to soften enough that you can mix it (don&#39;t let it melt!)"
- "Put the butter in a bowl, add the sugar and mix well. Add the beaten eggs little by little, mixing very well."
- "Add cake flour, baking powder and matcha with a spatula, and mix until the batter is evenly incorporated."
- "Add the yogurt and matcha essence, and mix."
- "Line a poundcake mold with parchment paper, and pour in the batter. Optionally, add amanatto to taste (dust the beans with a little flour first to prevent them from sinking to the bottom)."
- "Bake the cake in a preheated 355°F/180°C oven for 10 minutes. Take the cake out, and make a vertical slit in the middle of the cake."
- "The cut makes the cake rise nice and evenly. Turn the heat down to 320°F/160°C, bake the cake for an additional 30 minutes and it&#39;s done."
- "Put the cake mold on its side for a few minutes (this prevents the cake from falling apart). Put it back upright and leave to cool. When it&#39;s cooled, wrap in plastic wrap to prevent it from drying out."
- "This cake is delicious eaten when still warm. The yogurt makes it really moist. Give it a try!"
