Mug cakes are new to me — this isn&#39;t something I&#39;ve been making for years and years, it&#39;s literally been two weeks. I was inspired by this Paleo Mug Cake recipe from Paleo on a Budget.

Of course, every proper birthday cake needs a batch of buttercream schmeared up top. Paleo chocolate frosting made with only two ingredients: coconut milk and dairy free chocolate chips!
