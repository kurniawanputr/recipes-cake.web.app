- " medium shallots minced"
- " Worcestershire sauce"
- " heavy cream"

recipeinstructions:
- "Clean and trim the mushrooms. Put two-thirds in a food processor and pulse until finely chopped. For the remaining mushrooms, cut them by hand into very thin slices."

- "Add the Worcestershire sauce, cream, and gorgonzola to the mushrooms. Turn the heat down to medium and stir until smooth and the cheese fully melted. Add salt and freshly cracked black pepper to taste. Take the pan off the heat and set aside to cool to room temperature."
- "Preheat your oven to 375 F. Fill the tart shells with the mushroom filling and bake according to the tart shell instructions. Best eaten hot from the oven. If you have extra filling left over, it&#39;s excellent served on toast."
