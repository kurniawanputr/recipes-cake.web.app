recipeingredient:
- "4 tbsp. unsalted butter softened to room temperature"
- "1/2 cup granulated sugar"
- "1 large egg room temperature"
- "1/4 tsp. vanilla extract"
- "1/2 cup all purpose flour"
- "1/8 tsp. baking powder"
- "3 tbsp.  1 tsp milk divided"
- "2 tbsp. cocoa powder"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat the oven to 350°F. Grease a mini loaf tin (5 3/4 x 3 x 2&#34;) with non-stick cooking spray and set aside."
- "In a medium bowl, using a hand mixer, cream together the butter and sugar until fluffy and lighter in color. Then mix in the egg and vanilla."
- "Mix in about half of the flour mixture and the baking powder. Then mix in the 3 tbsp. of milk, then the remaining flour, until just combined."
- "Move 2 heaping tbsp. of the batter to a separate bowl...this will be your chocolate batter. Pour the remaining batter into the loaf tin."
- "To the additional 2 tbsp. of batter, stir in the remaining 1 tsp. of milk and the cocoa powder. Once well blended, place dollops of the chocolate batter over the top of the other batter and swirl it together with either a toothpick or knife."
- "Bake for 35-40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out mostly clean with just a few moist crumbs. You may want to cover you loaf tin loosely with foil after the 25 minute mark. This isn&#39;t called for in the original recipe, but I think mine browned a bit too much around the edges."
- "Once done, place the muffin tin on a wire rack to cool completely before removing from the pan. Slice and enjoy!"
