- " Extra Virgin Olive Oil from Spain"
recipeinstructions:
- "Wash the leeks thoroughly, making a lengthwise cut to separate the layers and remove any dirt with running water."
- "Put 8 generous tablespoons of Extra Virgin Olive Oil from Spain in a large pan fry the sliced leeks until they start turning golden around the edges, and smell delicious!"
- "Add the pumpkin, cut into cubes, season to taste and cook for 2-3 minutes. The pumpkin is absorbing the flavour of the leeks and the Extra Virgin Olive Oil from Spain."
- "Add the paprika and cayenne. Stir well so all the flavours mix together."
- "Add the half cup of water. Remember that a pumpkin is 90% water, and it will give off that water while cooking. Put a lid on the pan and simmer for 30 minutes until the pumpkin is tender."
- "After 30 minutes, beat the mixture with a hand-held blender or in a food processor until you have a smooth cream. In the last few seconds of beating, add the single cream."
- "To decorate the soup, put a couple of tablespoons of Extra Virgin Olive Oil from Spain in a frying pan and flash-fry some little cubes of pumpkin."
- "Serve the soup with the pumpkin ‘croutons’ and a drizzle of Extra Virgin Olive Oil from Spain to add its incomparable smoothness and texture."
