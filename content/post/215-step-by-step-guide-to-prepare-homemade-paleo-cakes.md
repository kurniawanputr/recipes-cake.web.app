We created a totally paleo vanilla cake with fluffy buttercream that&#39;s so good, even non-paleo friends will approve. Of course, every proper birthday cake needs a batch of buttercream schmeared up top. Paleo chocolate frosting made with only two ingredients: coconut milk and dairy free chocolate chips!
