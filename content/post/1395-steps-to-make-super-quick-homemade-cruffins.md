recipeingredient:
- "1-1/2 cups whole milk 12 oz339 g"
- "1/4 cups white Sugar 50 g"
- "1 Tbsp  1 tsp sea salt 15 grams"
- "4-1/4 Cups all purpose flour 510grams plus more for the butter block and rolling"
- "1 cup  6 Tbsp butter 310grams"
- " White Sugar for rolling"
- " For the dough"
recipeinstructions:
- "In the bowl of the stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, combine the flour, sugar, yeast, and salt. Whisk them together to combine, then pour in the milk while the mixer runs on low speed. Continue to mix until all flour is incorporated, then turn it up to medium speed and mix until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes"
- "Place dough in a clean bowl, cover with a kitchen towel and let it rise for about an hour, or until slightly puffy and soft. Place in the refrigerator for at least an hour, or over night if you can."
- "Prepare two pieces of parchment paper lay one on your work surface and sprinkle it generously with flower. Lay out your butter on the flower parchment it should be cold but not completely firm, or it will just break up into chunks. If you’re using sticks, cut them in half lengthwise and lay them side-by-side"
- "Sprinkle the top of the butter generously with flour, lay the other sheet of parchment on top and gently bash it/roll out with the rolling pin until it is about 8”x8”. Set it in the refrigerator until dough is ready"
- "To laminate the dough:"
- "On a floured surface roll out the door into a square about 10“ x 10“ then lay butter block on top at an angle so that you have a diamond on top of the square. Pull the edges of the dough up and around the butter pinching at the seams to seal it in"
- "Next take your rolling pin and gently tap up and down along the dough beginning to spread out the butter and pushing it out into a more rectangular shape. Gently roll the door into one direction strokes (not going back-and-forth over it) until you have a rectangle measure 18”x 10“. fold one third of the end of the rectangle over the center and follow with the other end. The dough will be folded like a letter. Wrap it in plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes"
- "Remove the rolling/folding/refrigerating process repeat 3 times then your dough is ready to shape"
- "To Shape the Cruffins"
- "Begin by cutting the dough in half instead shaping like a traditional croissant, roll each half of dough into rectangles a bit larger than 8’ x 15” keeping the edges as straight as possible. Trim off any uneven edges then cut them into 1” strips lengthwise so that you have 8-1” wide strips that are 15’ long."
- "Roll each strip into a spiral, wrapping the end over the top and then securing it underneath. Place each roll into a muffin tin, then place in a clean plastic bag to rise, tucking the ends of the bag under to protect the dough from drafts. Allow them to rise for 1-1/2-2 hours, or until the dough is soft and puffy."
- "Bake at 425 for about 5-8 minutes then turn it down to 375f and continue to bake for another 20-25 minutes, or until the edges are deep golden brown. Remove them from the oven, and allow them to cool so that you can handle them without burning your fingers. Roll the warm cruffins in white sugar, then fill or top if desired. These best the day they are baked."
