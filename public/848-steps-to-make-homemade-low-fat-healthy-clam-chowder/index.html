In this healthy clam chowder recipe, traditional heavy cream is replaced with milk and flour-thickened clam juice and we keep sodium amounts reasonable with lower-sodium clam juice instead of higher-sodium broths. The classic clam chowder recipe got reinvented, but it still maintains all that bacon and its creamy taste without, well, all that extra cream.</p>
