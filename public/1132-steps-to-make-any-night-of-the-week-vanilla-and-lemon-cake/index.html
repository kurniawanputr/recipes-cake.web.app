<p>Just recently I remade this and. The cake is made with whole grain spelt flour, natural sweeteners and a just enough mathca powder for a light green tea flavor. It's nutritious enough to be served as a snack cake or even breakfast if you want. Line a rimmed baking pan with foil. Invert cake onto wire rack; place cake over prepared pan.</p>
