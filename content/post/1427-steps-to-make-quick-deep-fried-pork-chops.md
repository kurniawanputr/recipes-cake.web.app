recipeinstructions:
- "Heat your oil in a big enough, high sided skillet on medium high heat. I put a lid on it and do my dredging while it heats up."
- "In a dish, add your flour and seasonings. Go heavy on the seasonings. Stir it together. Salt and pepper both sides of your chops. Roll the chops in the flour and cover completely. Let them sit until the flour starts soaking into the chops. Roll again and do the same. By the time your oil is ready your chops will be thickly dredged. They’ll still have a dampish look to them."
- "I do mine in batches. Do NOT add to oil until the oil is hot enough. I’d say 350 to 375. When it’s hot enough, lay a couple of chops in the oil and let it fry. When the bubbling slows and the color is right you’ll know they’re done."

##### Steps to make Deep Fried Pork Chops:

1. Heat your oil in a big enough, high sided skillet on medium high heat. I put a lid on it and do my dredging while it heats up.
1. In a dish, add your flour and seasonings. Go heavy on the seasonings. Stir it together. Salt and pepper both sides of your chops. Roll the chops in the flour and cover completely. Let them sit until the flour starts soaking into the chops. Roll again and do the same. By the time your oil is ready your chops will be thickly dredged. They’ll still have a dampish look to them.
1. I do mine in batches. Do NOT add to oil until the oil is hot enough. I’d say 350 to 375. When it’s hot enough, lay a couple of chops in the oil and let it fry. When the bubbling slows and the color is right you’ll know they’re done.


They&#39;re easy to pound thin and result in a more flavorful result. If thicker pork chops are your only option, you might not be able to pound them into. Arrange the pork chops in a large shallow dish. Season each pork chop, on both sides, with salt, black pepper, garlic powder, cayenne pepper and celery seeds. Using tongs, gently lower the chops into the deep skillet in batches if necessary.
