- "Put butter in a bowl and add soft light brown sugar in 2 portions. Mix until it becomes white and fluffy."
- "Add beaten egg in 3 to 4 potions and mix well each time you add it. It easily becomes separated so be careful ! I recommend using a hand mixer."
- "Add the 1/3 of the sifted flour and mix. Then add the syrup from chestnuts simmered in inner skins, rum liquor and continue mixing."

- "Take the cake out of the cake pan and wrap it tightly with a cellophane wrap. Let it sit for one night. This increases the moist texture. If you let it sit for 2 nights, it will be more moist."
- "There are lots of small sized cut chestnuts and big sized cut chestnuts in the cake It is irresistibly delicious."
