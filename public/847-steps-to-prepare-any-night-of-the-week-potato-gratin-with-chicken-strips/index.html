<p>Hey everyone, hope you&rsquo;re having an amazing day today. Today, we&rsquo;re going to make a special dish, potato gratin with chicken strips. It is one of my favorites food recipes. For mine, I am going to make it a little bit unique. This is gonna smell and look delicious.</p>
<p>Potato gratin with chicken strips is one of the most popular of recent trending foods in the world. It is enjoyed by millions daily. It&rsquo;s easy, it is quick, it tastes yummy. They are nice and they look wonderful. Potato gratin with chicken strips is something that I&rsquo;ve loved my whole life.</p>
<p>Being big fans of chicken pot pie, our family loves the combination of shredded chicken breast and potatoes. Oftentimes, however, my pot pies are So that we can have our chicken and eat our potatoes too, I decided to get creative with standard potatoes au gratin. Pair your lamb roast with a delicious potato gratin and broiled asparagus.</p>
<p>To get started with this particular recipe, we must first prepare a few components. You can have potato gratin with chicken strips using 9 ingredients and 2 steps. Here is how you can achieve it.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="the-ingredients-needed-to-make-potato-gratin-with-chicken-strips">The ingredients needed to make Potato gratin with chicken strips:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Prepare  Potato</li>
<li>Make ready  gChicken breast</li>
<li>Make ready  eggs</li>
<li>Prepare  mlCream mattress or 3 yawort natural</li>
<li>Get  Cheddar cheese and red cheese</li>
<li>Make ready  milk</li>
<li>Take  onions</li>
<li>Get  Garlic powder, mustard, thyme, black pepper, salt and olive oil</li>
<li>Make ready  parsley</li>
</ol>
<p>Season with salt and pepper and dust with flour. Wash, peel and thinly slice the potatoes, using a mandolin vegetable slicer if available. Then arrange evenly in overlapping layers in the gratin dish. Add mixture to potatoes and combine carefully without breaking the potato slices.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="steps-to-make-potato-gratin-with-chicken-strips">Steps to make Potato gratin with chicken strips:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Sauté the chicken meat pieces well with garlic, mustard, and thyme dressing -  Black pepper - Then saute the onion slices with olive oil well, then add the fried chicken slices and mix them together, then fry the potatoes and prepare the oven tray with butter to put on top of a first layer of potatoes, then the chicken breast slices with onions, then prepare a creamy mixture of cream, cheese, milk and The eggs and put them on the baking tray above the rest of the ingredients</li>
<li>The cooking time does not exceed 30 minutes</li>
</ol>
<p>Spread the chicken and potato mixture evenly on a rimmed sheet pan. As with scalloped potatoes or any potato gratin, you want to make sure your potatoes are thinly sliced so they come out tender. Likewise, you'll want to slice the onions very thinly as well so they don't overpower the dish. If you don't have chicken tenders, you can either pound some chicken breasts. Some potato gratin recipes call for soaking potatoes prior to assembling the gratin, but that's not necessary here.</p>
