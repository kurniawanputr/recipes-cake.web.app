##### The ingredients needed to make Salmon Cakes:

1. Take  cooked salmon (or 6 oz canned, drained)

With a crisp breading exterior, the salmon cakes are far from bland, since they have onions. If you enjoy seafood, salmon cakes can be a tasty new way to enjoy a fish dinner. Combined with herbs and spices, the salmon gets a crunchy, crisp coating from frying or baking it in small. I get pretty sick of meat.

However, my budget will NOT allow it. I need to talk to my sushi place and ask them to make me all fish rolls, leaving out. They&#39;re flavorful, crispy on the outside, and perfectly moist thanks to the sweet potato. These salmon patties (salmon cakes) are incredibly moist, delicious and flavorful - they&#39;re also gluten-free, paleo and low carb. I&#39;ve made them with fresh salmon, but you could also use canned salmon.
