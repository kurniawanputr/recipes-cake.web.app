However, my budget will NOT allow it. I need to talk to my sushi place and ask them to make me all fish rolls, leaving out. They&#39;re flavorful, crispy on the outside, and perfectly moist thanks to the sweet potato. These salmon patties (salmon cakes) are incredibly moist, delicious and flavorful - they&#39;re also gluten-free, paleo and low carb. I&#39;ve made them with fresh salmon, but you could also use canned salmon.
