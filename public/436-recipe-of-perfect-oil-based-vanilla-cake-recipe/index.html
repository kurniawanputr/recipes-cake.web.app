<p>Hello everybody, it&rsquo;s John, welcome to my recipe site. Today, I will show you a way to make a special dish, oil based vanilla cake recipe. It is one of my favorites food recipes. This time, I will make it a bit unique. This will be really delicious.</p>
<p>Oil based vanilla cake recipe is one of the most popular of current trending meals on earth. It&rsquo;s easy, it is quick, it tastes yummy. It&rsquo;s enjoyed by millions every day. Oil based vanilla cake recipe is something which I&rsquo;ve loved my entire life. They are nice and they look wonderful.</p>
<p>This easy vanilla cake recipe makes the most moist cake that's covered with my favorite vanilla buttercream frosting. This is not a light and fluffy cake I prefer oil-based cakes over butter-based cakes because oil tends to make cakes moister. It also makes the crumb and texture a bit more tender.</p>
<p>To begin with this recipe, we have to first prepare a few ingredients. You can cook oil based vanilla cake recipe using 7 ingredients and 3 steps. Here is how you can achieve it.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="the-ingredients-needed-to-make-oil-based-vanilla-cake-recipe">The ingredients needed to make Oil based vanilla cake recipe:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Take  flour</li>
<li>Take  veg oil</li>
<li>Take  eggs</li>
<li>Take  sugar</li>
<li>Prepare  baking powder</li>
<li>Make ready  Luke warm water or milk</li>
<li>Prepare  Flavor</li>
</ol>
<p>Or to be more specific, a moist vanilla cupcake recipe with oil!! Cakes take so much time to make and decorate, but cupcakes come together in a flash!! You can add in different extracts, fillings, or frostings, and transform this base recipe into a million different cupcake flavors. Oil-based cakes are quick to whip together, are incredibly moist and tender, and taste great for days after they're baked.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="steps-to-make-oil-based-vanilla-cake-recipe">Steps to make Oil based vanilla cake recipe:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Sieve flour and baking powder and keep aside.grease your pan with cooking spray and dust with flour keep aside</li>
<li>In another bowl whisk your egg very well add sugar and veg oil mix for about 2mins.add your flour mix then add the milk and flavor</li>
<li>Put your cake batter in the pan and bake for about 35-40mins or until skewer is insert and come out clean.allow it to cool and decorate</li>
</ol>
<p>Over-mixing a cake batter leads to too much gluten-development, and a tough cake. Blend cake mix, eggs, oil and water until moistened. Oil based cakes retain moisture and stays soft in fridge. So if you are trying a fresh fruit cake or a black forest cake, you need to select a oil based cake My best chocolate cake recipe is one such recipe and I converted it into a vanilla cake. Usually I convert vanilla cakes to chocolate ones but here I.</p>
<p>So that is going to wrap it up with this special food oil based vanilla cake recipe recipe. Thanks so much for reading. I am sure you can make this at home. There is gonna be interesting food in home recipes coming up. Remember to bookmark this page on your browser, and share it to your loved ones, friends and colleague. Thanks again for reading.
