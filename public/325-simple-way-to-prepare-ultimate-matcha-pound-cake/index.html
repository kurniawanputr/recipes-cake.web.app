<p>Hey everyone, it is Drew, welcome to my recipe page. Today, I will show you a way to prepare a distinctive dish, matcha pound cake üçµ. It is one of my favorites food recipes. For mine, I will make it a bit unique. This is gonna smell and look delicious.</p>
<p>Pound cakes are denser than most cakes. The exterior of the cake starts to bake first in the oven, and as the heat that is released from the still-baking batter My oldest daughter's boyfriend loves matcha, so I can't wait to make this at our fourth of July weekend this summer. A very simple and straightforward pound cake recipe with matcha (Japanese green tea powder), without the use of any baking soda and baking powder.</p>
<p>Matcha pound cake üçµ is one of the most favored of current trending foods in the world. It is enjoyed by millions every day. It is simple, it&rsquo;s fast, it tastes yummy. They&rsquo;re fine and they look fantastic. Matcha pound cake üçµ is something that I&rsquo;ve loved my whole life.</p>
<p>To begin with this recipe, we have to first prepare a few ingredients. You can cook matcha pound cake üçµ using 5 ingredients and 6 steps. Here is how you cook that.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="the-ingredients-needed-to-make-matcha-pound-cake-">The ingredients needed to make Matcha pound cake üçµ:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Get 50 g butter</li>
<li>Get 50 g caster suger</li>
<li>Prepare 50 g self raising flour</li>
<li>Make ready 1 egg</li>
<li>Prepare 1/2 tea spoon matcha</li>
</ol>
<p>Sift together cake flour, matcha powder, baking powder and salt. Matcha is a kind of green tea that is powdered, which is traditionally used for the Japanese tea ceremony. Matcha Pound Cake goes with regular green tea, coffee, or even milk. It is a wonderful dessert for a special tea time.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="instructions-to-make-matcha-pound-cake-">Instructions to make Matcha pound cake üçµ:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Preheat the oven on 170¬∞C. Prepare 50g room temperature butter is a bowl. Add 50g of caster sugar, and beat them until smooth. I used a wooden spoon since I don't have electronic mixer inn my kitchen. It's not so different and didn't take too much extra time and effort as long as the butter was at room temperature. You will want to achieve a matte finish.</li>
<li>Break an egg in a separate bowl, and measure only 50g to add to the mixture bowl. Mix the mixture with a silicon stapula.</li>
<li>Measure another 50 gram of self raising flour. Add to the mixture bowl batch by batch. You don't want to throw all the flour at once because that could make it hard to mix evenly. I added the flour in roughly 6 batches.</li>
<li>This is an optional step. I added 1/2 tea spoon of matcha powder. You can use chocolate power instead if you don't have matcha powder. That will turn the pound cake to chocolate flavour obviously. When it's mixed well, you are ready to pour them in the tin.</li>
<li>Prepare a baking tin brushed gently with butter and tear a layer of baking paper to the tin. Pour the mixture in the tin and make it even. Put the tin with mixture in oven at 170¬∞C for about 30 minutes.</li>
<li>Again this is optional but we sprinkled a bit more matcha powder on top of the cake before serve :)
