<p>Herbal Tea Pound Cake is one of the most favored of recent trending foods in the world. It is enjoyed by millions every day. It&rsquo;s easy, it&rsquo;s fast, it tastes yummy. Herbal Tea Pound Cake is something that I have loved my entire life. They are nice and they look fantastic.</p>
<p>To get started with this recipe, we must first prepare a few ingredients. You can have herbal tea pound cake using 7 ingredients and 12 steps. Here is how you can achieve that.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="the-ingredients-needed-to-make-herbal-tea-pound-cake">The ingredients needed to make Herbal Tea Pound Cake:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Prepare 100 grams Butter</li>
<li>Make ready 70 grams Sugar</li>
<li>Take 2 Eggs</li>
<li>Make ready 110 grams White flour</li>
<li>Prepare 1/2 tsp Baking powder</li>
<li>Make ready 2 tea bags  Flavoured tea of your choice</li>
<li>Take 30 ml Hot water</li>
</ol>
<p>For the &quot;emotional eater&quot; tea might just prove to be a great comfort food replacement. These tea cakes resemble the texture and flavor of a traditional pound cake, but I like to kick up the flavor a notch by adding some Earl Grey tea, stepped in warm milk. It's such a lovely flavor for a buttery pound cake and when combined with a little orange zest it definitely makes this cake otherworldly. Pound Cake - easy and the best pound cake recipe that calls for only a few ingredients.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="steps-to-make-herbal-tea-pound-cake">Steps to make Herbal Tea Pound Cake:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Line the cake tin with parchment paper. To learn how to neatly line a cake tin with paper, refer to. -  - <a href="https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/151090-how-to-neatly-line-a-cake-pan-with-parchment-paper">https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/151090-how-to-neatly-line-a-cake-pan-with-parchment-paper</a></li>
<li>Measure out all the ingredients. Sift the flour and baking powder together.</li>
<li>Steep one of the tea bags in hot water to brew a strong tea. Preheat the oven to 170°C.</li>
<li>Soften the butter until it has a mayonnaise-like consistency. (If straight out of the refrigerator, microwave it at 300 W for 50 seconds.)</li>
<li>Add the sugar, and and mix well until it is white and fluffy.</li>
<li>Beat the egg and add it to the mixture in small batches. Mix well.</li>
<li>Add the tea from Step 3.</li>

<p>The cake is so moist, buttery, rich and creamy. Serve this cake with other sweet treats. For an afternoon tea party, I recommend the following recipes. Pound Cakes are so named because originally they were made with one pound of butter, one pound of sugar, one pound of eggs, and one pound of flour. In France, a Pound Cake goes by the name Quatre Quarts, which means four quarters, referring to the quantities of the ingredients.</p>
