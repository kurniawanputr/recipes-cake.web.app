<p>Hey everyone, hope you are having an amazing day today. Today, I will show you a way to prepare a special dish, salmon cakes. It is one of my favorites food recipes. This time, I&rsquo;m gonna make it a bit unique. This is gonna smell and look delicious.</p>
<p>See more ideas about Salmon cakes, Fish recipes, Seafood recipes. Salmon cakes can be served as sandwiches or without the bread as a main course. Scrumptious Salmon Cakes Haiku: &quot;Close as I could get, had to make some little swaps, still they were quite good.&quot; Salmon patties, or salmon cakes, are wonderfully easy to make.</p>
<p>Salmon Cakes is one of the most well liked of current trending foods in the world. It&rsquo;s easy, it is quick, it tastes delicious. It&rsquo;s enjoyed by millions daily. Salmon Cakes is something that I&rsquo;ve loved my entire life. They&rsquo;re fine and they look fantastic.</p>
<p>To begin with this particular recipe, we must prepare a few ingredients. You can have salmon cakes using 10 ingredients and 5 steps. Here is how you can achieve that.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="the-ingredients-needed-to-make-salmon-cakes">The ingredients needed to make Salmon Cakes:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Get 10 oz chunk salmon (skinless boneless)</li>
<li>Prepare 2/3 cup Bread crumbs</li>
<li>Take 1 egg (beaten)</li>
<li>Get 1/2 red bell pepper (chopped)</li>
<li>Take 1 tbsp Chopped green onions</li>
<li>Prepare 1 tbsp old bay seasoning</li>
<li>Prepare 1 tbsp dill</li>
<li>Prepare 1 tsp Franks red-hot sauce (or any cayenne pepper sauce)</li>
<li>Make ready 1/2 Lemon (zest only)</li>
<li>Make ready 1 vegetable oil (for frying)</li>
</ol>
<p>With a crisp breading exterior, the salmon cakes are far from bland, since they have onions. If you enjoy seafood, salmon cakes can be a tasty new way to enjoy a fish dinner. Combined with herbs and spices, the salmon gets a crunchy, crisp coating from frying or baking it in small. I get pretty sick of meat.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="steps-to-make-salmon-cakes">Steps to make Salmon Cakes:</h5>
<ol>
<li>In medium bowl mix together salmon and bread crumbs.</li>
<li>Beat 1 egg and add to salmon mix along with the rest of the ingredients (except oil) adding more bread crumbs of mixture is too wet.</li>
<li>Form 3 inch long patties about an inch thick, should get about 4 patties.</li>
<li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Enough so that about a half an inch of oil covers the bottom of skillet.</li>
<li>Fry each patty for about 3 minutes per side or until golden brown. Transfer to a plate lined with a paper town to let cool. Serve with your favorite tartar sauce.</li>
</ol>
<p>However, my budget will NOT allow it. I need to talk to my sushi place and ask them to make me all fish rolls, leaving out. They're flavorful, crispy on the outside, and perfectly moist thanks to the sweet potato. These salmon patties (salmon cakes) are incredibly moist, delicious and flavorful - they're also gluten-free, paleo and low carb. I've made them with fresh salmon, but you could also use canned salmon.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s going to wrap this up for this exceptional food salmon cakes recipe. Thank you very much for your time. I&rsquo;m sure you will make this at home. There is gonna be interesting food at home recipes coming up. Remember to save this page on your browser, and share it to your family, friends and colleague. Thank you for reading. Go on get cooking!</p>
